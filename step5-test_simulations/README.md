# Testing the scenario in the simulation

---
### Testing scenario
---

In this step, you will test the scenario that has been built previously. For this, only the main scenario files are used (.j3o,.mtl, *.png, etc.).

- The first thing to do is find the scenario files.
- The files are moved to the resources directory of the PHAT project. Create a directory for this new scenario.
- After placing the files in the new directory, you create a new type of house, following the syntax of PHAT and 
invoking the main file <b>(.j3o)</b>.
