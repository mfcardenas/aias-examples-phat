# Testing the scenario in the simulation

---
### Testing scenario
---

In this step we will test the scenario we have built previously. For this, we will use only the main files of the stage (.j3o,.mtl, *.png, etc.).

- The first thing to do is find the scenario files.
- The files are moved to the resources directory of the PHAT project. Create a directory for this new scenario.
- After placing the files in the new directory, we will have to create a new type of scenario.
