# Descomposition objects

---
### Define the objects that will participate in the simulation
--- 

#### Decorative objects or interactive objects.

The objects included on the stage, as indicated above, may be decorative or interactive. 
Both decorative and interactive objects can be included when the stage is built. However, it is recommended that the interactive objects be included later. This makes it easier to manipulate them to assign the desired behaviour with the corresponding animation technique.

### Create the stage with the decorative objects
When the stage is created, the different elements that will adorn it are embedded in it. As you can see from the picture below, all the furniture in the house has been put in its rightful place. The more detailed this process is, the more realistic the house used in the simulation will be.

#### The furniture
The initial installation of SH3D features only a basic furniture gallery. To expand this gallery, there are free resources that third parties make available for your use. In the section of [SweetHome3D Galleries](http://www.sweethome3d.com/importModels.jsp) you can find different collections of furniture that will allow us to decorate the house with the furniture that exists in it.
